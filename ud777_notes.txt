READMEs are written for humans.

Lesson 6 : Anatomy of a README
Information: They explain more or everything about the package
Structure: Headings, links, snipets of code and a licence are present,
Patterns: There is one per package

Things to answer in a README
What steps need to be taken?
What should the user already have installed or configured?
What might they have a hard time understanding right away?

Things in a README
https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud777/l-5338568539/m-5331778616
Title & description - capture spirit of project, possibly logo?
Include info that is essential - dependencies, installation instructions, common usage, known bugs, etc
An installation section can be popular.
Make no assumptions and be clear.

Include a Contributing section and also then include copyright licence e.g. http://choosealicense.com/
Only a new info is needed, keep it simple e.g. known bugs, FAQ, table of contents

Markdown 101
Markdown is a light markup language often used for READMEs (though you'll find other use cases for it, too!). It is fairly straightforward, and much of the syntax is intuitive.

Bold: To make text bold, surround it with double asterisks, e.g. Isn't today a **wonderful** day?
Italics: To italicize text, surround it with underscores e.g. And in that moment I thought to myself: _Did I turn off the stove?_
Inline code: For this, you'll surround text in backticks (``, not a single quote), e.g. You should use the `strong` tag.

The Title Sequence: For h1 through h6 tags, all you'll need is a # before your text. The number of #s you include tells Markdown which header tag you're using. For example:
## This is a header.
### This is another header.

* bullet point

> quoting text / inline text (this is a little different to quoting code as font changed)



```     quoting a block of code (end with another ```)

# My Fabulous Recipe

This recipe for ** cereal and milk ** has been passed down my family for months.

## Ingredients

* Cereal (you can find cool cereals [here](www.example.com/coolcereals)
* Milk

## Directions

If I were writing these out as _code_, it might look something like this:

```
if bowl is empty: 
    add cereal  
if bowl only has cereal in it:  
    add milk
```
